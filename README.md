## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Used paint.net to determine component colors, dimensions, and padding/margins

### What I learned

Learned how to use css grid statically and in a responsive layout. 
After some trial and error I learned to put the shadow box on the grid-container to work in a responsive layout.

```css
  /* The grid container */
  .grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-areas: 
      'header header' 
      'left right';
    /* grid-column-gap: 10px; - if you want gap between the columns */
    
    max-width: 624px;
    box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 0px hsl(218, 22%, 67%);
    border-radius: 12px;
  }
```

### Continued development

I'd like to use css grid more and tryout other methods for grid layouts.

### Useful resources
